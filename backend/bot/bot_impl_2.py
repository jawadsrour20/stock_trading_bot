'''
The Turtle Trading system was coined by Richard Dennis and worked brilliantly for the traders in the 1980â€™s.
 But it turns out that the system requires some tweaking for it to reflect new market conditions and be effective now. 
 That said, trends still happen which means there are a plethora of trading opportunities.

The core of the turtle trading strategy is to take a position on futures on a 55-day breakout.
 A 55-day breakout is when the price exceeds high or low of past 55 days price.
